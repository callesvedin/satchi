## Bugs
- When adding content the keyboard hides the textfield. It also dissapears when entering character.
- Try to change workflow when adding track. We'd like to go directly to Lay track and add name afterwords.
- Change layout ov the TrackOverlayView so that the compass (shown when rotating view) is not hidden.
