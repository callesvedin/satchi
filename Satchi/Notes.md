#  General notes about the development

## TODO:

- Stop ListView from rerendering the whole hierarchy when a task is updated (state changed in map view)
- Add logging. Apple Logger spews out either too much or nothing depending on env variables. Not usable at the moment
- Make buttons in map view bigger
- Add cancel button on first map view screen
