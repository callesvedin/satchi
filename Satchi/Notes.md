## TODO:
- Rewrite the slide for difficulty in EditView. Maybe something like this https://medium.com/@alessandromanilii/animated-rating-view-in-swiftui-9b2f00e8196d .
- Add sharing
- Add logging
- Make time since... look better in edit view. Might contain years etc...
- Add GPS-accuracy in map.
- Track.created should not be set when the Track is created but when the laid path is saved.
- Delete removed shares
