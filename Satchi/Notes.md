#  General notes about the development

## TODO:

- Do not remove a track for user when the user stops sharing the track. Only the shareing should stop
- Add logging. Apple Logger spews out either too much or nothing depending on env variables. Not usable at the moment
- Add error info when trying to view share view without being connected to iCloud.
