#  General notes about the development

## TODO:

- Add logging. Apple Logger spews out either too much or nothing depending on env variables. Not usable at the moment
- Make time since... look better in edit view. Might contain years etc...
- Add GPS-accuracy in map.
- Track.created should not be set when the Track is created but when the laid path is saved.
- Delete removed shares
